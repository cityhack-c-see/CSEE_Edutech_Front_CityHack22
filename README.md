## Description of the Project (300 words)
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the need for online learning is skyrocketing day by day. Schools and college start to rely on distance learning. However, this kind of learning mode brings several problems, such as lack of interaction. Droom provided an innovative way for students and teachers to interact.

Very often teachers have a hard time to interact with students through online meeting applications. For example, it always become very difficult when teachers want to show students some ideas or explanations by writing something on the whiteboard, unfortunately, due to the webcam quality and distance between the whiteboard and the camera, students often can't really see what's on the whiteboard clearly. Now, Droom provides an user-friendly application which allows teachers to have live streaming on what he wrote or draw on the virtual paper on droom.

Moreover, getting students feedbacks was a huge chanllenge in the past because students usually can use words to express their problems or comments. Droom offers a solution to this problem, it provides a on-paper interation for education, students can now use drawing or even writing formulas to express their questions and comments.

Last but not least, Droom is based on Flutter, the advantage is that we only need to write one code for Flutter, and have all Android, IOS, Web, Window and, MACOS. Which means you can basically use this app everywhere you find a smart gadgets.
